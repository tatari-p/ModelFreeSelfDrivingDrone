# ModelFreeSelfDrivingDrone

Tensorflow implementation of self driving drone using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Galaga method.

Microsoft AirSim is needed.

For random target, it achieves about 82% success rate using 18 layer ResNET and 2 layer fully connected only.

It uses depth map for image processing, and I think more deep network will be needed to use raw RGB input.
